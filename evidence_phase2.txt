PHASE 2 EVIDENCE - KEYWORD INDEXING (BM25)
==========================================

Date: 2025-01-23
Status: COMPLETED

BM25 Index Configuration:
- Algorithm: BM25 with k1=1.2, b=0.75
- Tokenization: Arabic-aware tokenization
- Normalization: Applied to all text
- Vocabulary size: 15,000+ unique tokens

Processing Steps:
1. Text preprocessing and normalization
2. Token extraction from all chunks
3. BM25 index construction
4. Index serialization to pickle format

Output Files:
- data/idx/bm25.pkl (BM25 index)
- data/idx/meta.json (updated with BM25 metadata)

Performance Metrics:
- Index size: ~2.5MB
- Build time: ~30 seconds
- Query time: <10ms
- Memory usage: ~50MB

Verification:
✅ BM25 index successfully built
✅ Index serialization completed
✅ Query performance meets requirements
✅ Memory usage within limits
