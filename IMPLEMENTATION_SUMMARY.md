# 🎉 RBAC Implementation Complete!

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Complete Authentication System**
- JWT-based authentication with secure token management
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- User management with predefined roles (admin, legal, staff)
- Session management with configurable expiration

### 2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- **Admin**: Full access to all documents including restricted ones
- **Legal**: Access to general documents and restricted documents  
- **Staff**: Access to general documents only
- Hierarchical role system with effective role calculation

### 3. **File Restriction Logic**
- Documents with "restricted" in their names are automatically restricted
- Only `legal` and `admin` roles can access restricted documents
- `staff` users cannot see restricted documents
- Transparent filtering with user notifications about hidden results

### 4. **Frontend Integration**
- Complete login interface with Arabic RTL support
- Role-based UI that adapts to user permissions
- User information display showing current access level
- Automatic session management and logout on token expiration
- Access information panel showing user's permission level

### 5. **API Endpoints**
- `POST /login` - User authentication
- `GET /me` - Get current user information
- `GET /users` - List all users (admin only)
- `POST /ask` - Search with RBAC filtering

### 6. **Testing & Documentation**
- Test restricted documents added to the system
- CLI script updated with RBAC support
- Comprehensive test script for validation
- Complete documentation and setup instructions

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. **Start the Server**
```bash
uvicorn app.run_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### 2. **Access the Web Interface**
Open `http://localhost:8000` and login with:
- **Admin**: `admin` / `admin123` (Full access)
- **Legal**: `legal` / `legal123` (Legal + Restricted access)
- **Staff**: `staff` / `staff123` (General access only)

### 3. **Test Different Access Levels**
- Login as `staff` and search for "restricted" - you won't see restricted documents
- Login as `legal` and search for "restricted" - you'll see all documents
- Login as `admin` and search for "restricted" - you'll see all documents

### 4. **CLI Testing**
```bash
# Test as staff (limited access)
python scripts/05_query_cli.py --query "الطاقة النووية" --roles staff --show-restricted

# Test as legal (full access)
python scripts/05_query_cli.py --query "الطاقة النووية" --roles legal --show-restricted
```

## 🔒 Security Features

- **JWT tokens** with expiration for secure authentication
- **Role-based permissions** enforced at API level
- **Document-level filtering** based on file names containing "restricted"
- **Secure password storage** using bcrypt hashing
- **Session management** with automatic logout on token expiration

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `app/auth.py` - Complete authentication and RBAC system
- `scripts/add_restricted_docs.py` - Script to add test restricted documents
- `scripts/test_rbac.py` - Comprehensive test script
- `RBAC_README.md` - Complete documentation

### Modified Files:
- `app/run_api.py` - Integrated RBAC with authentication endpoints
- `app/retrieval.py` - Enhanced with RBAC filtering
- `scripts/05_query_cli.py` - Updated with RBAC support
- `requirements.txt` - Added authentication dependencies

## 🎯 Key Features Demonstrated

1. **File Restriction**: Documents with "restricted" in their names are automatically restricted to legal and admin users only
2. **Role Hierarchy**: Admin > Legal > Staff with proper inheritance
3. **Transparent Access Control**: Users are informed about their access level and any hidden results
4. **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with proper session management
5. **Arabic RTL Support**: Complete frontend with proper Arabic language support

## 🔧 Customization Options

- **Add new roles**: Update `ROLE_HIERARCHY` in `app/auth.py`
- **Modify access rules**: Update `check_file_access()` function
- **Add new users**: Update `USERS_DB` in `app/auth.py`
- **Change restriction criteria**: Modify the "restricted" keyword logic

## 🎉 Success!

The RBAC system is now fully implemented and ready for use. Users can:
- Login with different role levels
- See only documents they have permission to access
- Get clear feedback about their access level
- Experience seamless role-based document filtering

The system automatically restricts access to any document with "restricted" in its name, ensuring that only legal and admin users can access sensitive information while staff users are limited to general documents.
